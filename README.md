# SMUM-Checkin
Checkin web app (SPA) for Santa Maria Urban Ministries in San Jose California.

The app is used at the front desk for intake of clients. The services provided to low-income families & homeless individuals include:

<ol>
  <li>Food Pantry
  <li>Clothing
  <li>Hygiene Supplies
  <li>Christmas Gifts for Children
  <li>Thanksgiving Turkeys
</ol>

SMUM-Checkin manages client registration and facilitates the  provision of available service by the volunteers. Since each service has a period of availability, minimum frequency, and target recipients, the software handles all of the calculating &mdash; offering the volunteer a simplified number of choices to offer the client.

### Community Developed
This project is seeking to involve software developers from the surrounding community of San Jose and beyond. We want to offer young developers an outlet for volunteering to their local community by doing what they enjoy doing.

#### High School Tech Volunteer Program
We are reaching out to regional high schools to build long-term relationships and to help promote this Tech Volunteer Program to their students. We believe this is a great opportunity to introduce students to the idea of helping build tools for communities in need.

### Future Development
This is an ongoing development project supported by volunteers. The goal is to have near continuous development of improvements and new features. Some of the planned features can be seen below.

#### Integrated Printer
A future version of SMUM-Checkin is intended to integrate with a receipt printer. This will reduce errors, improve security, and speed up the time it takes to help each client.

#### Service Programs
We hope to also integrate the management of service programs offered at SMUM. Santa Maria Urban Ministries offers a number of program including an After-school Homework Center, ABC Playtime Preschool, ESL Classes and more. We hope to integrate the registration and management into the system.

#### Community Communication
Another feature that we are considering adding is the ability to reach out to volunteers and clients via email and SMS. This would provide SMUM the means to inform stakeholders of changes in policies, programs, schedules, and special community events.
